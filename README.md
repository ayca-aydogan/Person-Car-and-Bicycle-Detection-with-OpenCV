# Person-Car-and-Bicycle-Detection-with-OpenCV

This project is done to detect an object chosen by the user (Person, Bicycle, or Car) from the chosen source(camera_id or video path).

Qt is used to create the GUI, and for image processing, the OpenCV library is used. YOLO is chosen as the object detection algorithm.
YOLOâ€™s COCO pre-trained weights is used for detection as it contains the specified object classes. YOLOv3-608 is selected as the model to have 
optimum accuracy values. Detection is done on GPU to accelerate the process.
